# --- Deployment Environment Specifics (Streamlit Cloud uses a Python version) ---
# Specify Python 3.10 as used in your setup script
# This is usually placed in a file named 'runtime.txt' for Streamlit, 
# but including it here provides clarity for other pipelines.
# For Streamlit Cloud, also include a 'runtime.txt' file with just: python-3.10
